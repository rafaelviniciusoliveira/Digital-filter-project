# Digital filter project

## Objectives
This project was developed during the class of discrete signal precessing with the purpose of understand the use of digital filters.

## Steps
* Import python tools
* Load the audio
* Choose one channel of the audio
* Plot the frequency spectrum
* Load the FIR filter
* Overlap-add convolution
* Plot the filtered frequency spectrum
* Decimation (M = 2)
* Recreate the filtered and decimated audio
